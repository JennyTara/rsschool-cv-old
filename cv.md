## Profile
My first acquaintance with html started with small tasks concerning site administration while working in tourism sphere. Little by little at my free time I began to explore the world of Frontend development.  After a while I passed interview, carried out a test case and finally got a html-developer position.
I have successfully finished the course "Website development using Html, css and js" at IT-Academy. 
After that course I got an offer from EPAM for a position of associate content strategist that I have accepted. Then I have been promoted for a position of content strategist, for now I have been working in EPAM for practically a year. 
Now I take part in The Rolling Scopes School course "JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0".
My strong qualities: responsibility, high efficiency, attentiveness to the details, easy learning, ability to work with a large amount of information, open to new knowledge, experience and challenges.
